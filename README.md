# Masked Enemy Overhaul Model API Fix
A mod for Lethal Company which allows for MaskedEnemyOverhaul mod to copy player models from ModelReplacementAPI.

Currently, MaskedEnemyOverhaul mimics only copy player suits, including modded suits, but only copying 
the texture/color when using mods that change the player model using ModelReplacementAPI, making masked 
enemies stick out like a sore thumb when playing with custom player models.


WARNING!!!

This Mod is in a trial period so it is not sure that it will work well yet.

This mod fixes compatibility with MaskedEnemyOveraul and ModelReplacementAPI.
